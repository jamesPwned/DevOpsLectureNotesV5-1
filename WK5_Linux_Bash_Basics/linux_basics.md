## What is Linux?
* Linux is an operating system or a kernel. 
* It is distributed under an open source license. 
* Its functionality list is quite like UNIX.

## Who created Linux?
Linux is an operating system or a kernel which germinated as an idea in the mind of young and bright __Linus Torvalds__ when he was a computer science student. He used to work on the __UNIX OS__ (proprietary software) and thought that it needed improvements.

However, when his suggestions were rejected by the designers of UNIX, he thought of launching an OS which will be receptive to changes, modifications suggested by its users.

So Linus devised a Kernel named Linux in 1991. 

## Benefits

* The main advantage of Linux was that programmers were able to use the Linux Kernel to design their own __custom operating systems__. With time, a new range of user-friendly OS's stormed the computer world. Now, Linux is one of the most popular and widely used Kernel, and it is the backbone of popular operating systems like __Debian, Redhat, Ubuntu, Fedora and Android__.

* And, it is open source.

* Since it is derived from Unix, so learning one is the same as learning another.
